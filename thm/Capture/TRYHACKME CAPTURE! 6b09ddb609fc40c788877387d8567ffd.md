# TRYHACKME CAPTURE!

The box is a web page with a login page
After few trials a math captcha comes up

which needs solving

There are 3 different errors

1. Error for Invalid Username
2. Error for Invalid Captcha
3. And lastly, Error for Invalid Password

I wrote a python script to brute force for the Username and Password, get the Captcha and solve it

Script Below
