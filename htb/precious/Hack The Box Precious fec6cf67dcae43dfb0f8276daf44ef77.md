On the web page, is a website that converts webpages to pdf.

I tried directory bruteforce, i got nothing

I then started a python web server to convert a controlled web page to PDFâ€™ i tried intercepting with burp to figure how it does the conversion or tool used but still nothing

I proceeded to checking with Subdomain bruteforce still got nothing.

after a while I decided to trace my step back, and I started again, stopping after downloading the PDF file, a thought came to my mind to check it probably thereâ€™s hidden file, creds or anything useful in it.

I used exiftool and found the tool used **pdfkit v0.8.6**

I copied and paste it in my browser, and boom its vulnerable to rce

I found and used this exploit 

[pdfkit 0.8.7.2 Command Injection â‰ˆ Packet Storm](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171746/pdfkit-0.8.7.2-Command-Injection.html)

I ran it with IP and port and I got access as user ruby

To get the parameter used for collecting IP

simply check source code

## Gaining Access

I generated ssh-keys since Iâ€™m user ruby and logged in using ssh

There are two users on the system Henry and ruby, trying to become user Henry I tried checking for any of Henryâ€™s file for password ðŸ˜† but got nothing

I traced my step back to ruby home directory and saw a config file in .bundle

## bash-5.1$ cd .bundle/
-bash-5.1$ ls
config
-bash-5.1$ cat config

BUNDLE_HTTPS://RUBYGEMS__ORG/: "henry:Q3c1AqGHtoI0aXAYFH"
-bash-5.1$

I used the password to ssh as user henry and got user flag

i knew from ther a file dependencies.yml is needed

i proceeded to google and search for **ruby update dependencies**

I found and used this exploit [Ruby exploit](https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/exploit/linux/privilege-escalation/ruby-privilege-escalation/)

i edited it to give bash suid permissions
